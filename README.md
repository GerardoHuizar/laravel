## About Laravel

Answers to question 4 and 5

4.- For this process we need put a timeout to request will dead, next of this catch all types od exceptions that we could have in the error, then send a message to user why failured the request. (speak in security it's possible that we could need a bridge with lamda function for data secure fron point to point)

5.- for this situation that we could have more than100k requests, i could think in a microservices architecture of containers with a balance system for distributed all load to different containers and if one container is down other containers are ability to receive the requests and like that we assurance the 100% disponility of service
